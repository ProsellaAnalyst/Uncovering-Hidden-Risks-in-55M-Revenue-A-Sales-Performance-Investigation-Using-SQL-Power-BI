Key metrics at a glance (2013–2016):  
- Total Sales: $55.82M (+8% YoY)  
- Total Orders: 23K (+10%)  
- Customers: 657 (+0% growth)  
- Avg Order Value: $2.39K (declining)  
- Monthly volatility hidden under yearly gains  
- Heavy concentration: Supermarket ~89%, few top cities/reps

## 2. Problem Area

Reported revenue growth concealed critical structural weaknesses once customer dynamics were fully analyzed.

Core issues uncovered:  
- 0% customer base growth (flat MRR)  
- Declining average order value  
- Extreme geographic and rep concentration  
- Severe monthly sales volatility masked by yearly totals  
- Unsustainable volume-led growth, not value-led

## 3. Who Is at Stake & What’s at Risk

**Primary stakeholders**: CEOs, boards, leadership teams, finance, sales directors.

**What’s at stake**:  
- Future revenue stagnation or collapse if acquisition slows  
- Increased vulnerability to shocks (category/city/rep loss)  
- Eroding margins from declining order value  
- Cash-flow instability from monthly swings  
- Missed opportunity to scale profitably and sustainably

Without decisive action, the business risks turning strong historical performance into fragile future results.

## 4. Big Idea + Approaches

**Big Idea**  
Transform hidden risks into clear, high-stakes decisions that protect and scale sustainable growth.

**Decision Intelligence Approaches**  
- Surface structural weaknesses through deep data analysis  
- Deliver urgent, prioritized recommendations focused on root causes  
- Shift from volume-led to value-led growth  
- Provide leadership with concrete, immediate actions – no further analysis needed

## 5. Impact of Recommendations

These four high-impact decisions deliver immediate protection and long-term growth:

1. **Launch aggressive customer acquisition immediately**  
   → Restores positive customer growth (ends 0% stagnation)  

2. **Revive underperforming cities urgently**  
   → Eliminates dangerous geographic concentration risk  

3. **Optimize sales territories & training fast**  
   → Closes massive top-to-bottom performer gap, lifts average output  

4. **Stabilize monthly volatility now**  
   → Fixes inventory, promotions, and coverage root causes for predictable revenue

Leadership can execute these strategies now.
